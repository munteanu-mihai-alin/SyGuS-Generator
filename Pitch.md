The problem my thesis solves the generation of syntax-guided synthesis problems 
using simmulated annealing to guide a random search and support vector machines 
to learn from successful/failed generated programs unlike:
1. DRYADSYNTH : A Concolic SyGuS Solver; which uses dynamic symbolic execution
2. Data-Driven Precondition Inference with Learned Features( solver LoopInvGen); which learns features from symbolic executions
3. SyGuS Techniques in the Core of an SMT Solver (cvc5 solver); classical smt techniques
