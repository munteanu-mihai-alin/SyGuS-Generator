Hello, my name is Mihai, the title of my thesis is 
"Fast discard strategy for generating SyGuS programs"
and it aims at improving capabilities of current syntax-guided synthesis problems solvers present in program synthesis.

First we explore the space of candidate programs using simmulated annealing and similar metaheuristic algorithms
In the second step we use cvc5 solver and analyze where symmetry breaking lemmas 

Syntax guided synthesis aims at generating programs based 
on providing both syntactic and regular smt constraints. 


It can be usedul for a wide-range of problems, most important being invariant generation.
