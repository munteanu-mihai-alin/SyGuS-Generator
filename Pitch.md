The problem my thesis solves is the generation of syntax-guided synthesis problems,represented by a function to synthesise, a grammar in BNF and semantic constraints, using simmulated annealing to guide a random search and existing solvers for generating successful/failed programs and support vector machines to classify candidate programs so that we accept/discard them early unlike:

[1]. DRYADSYNTH : A Concolic SyGuS Solver; which uses dynamic symbolic execution
[2]. Data-Driven Precondition Inference with Learned Features( solver LoopInvGen); which learns features from symbolic executions
[3]. SyGuS Techniques in the Core of an SMT Solver (cvc5 solver); which uses classical smt techniques
